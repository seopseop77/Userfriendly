**Last updated**: 2026-05-11 (Claude Code; ADR-0021 code-removal housekeeping landed — signing module / CLI / registry / `.sig` files all gone)
**Updated by**: Claude Code (signing-removal checkpoint, commit b446c3f)

## Current phase

- **Phase**: **ADR-0021 code-removal housekeeping closed.** The
  signing primitive is now fully retired from the codebase. The
  prior Phase-3a documentation checkpoint (4 of 7 ADRs settled —
  #5/#6/#3/#7 via ADR-0018/0019/0020/0021) is unchanged. The
  housekeeping was self-contained delete-only: no behavior added,
  no public interface beyond the retired CLI commands changed.
  Codebase is now at commit b446c3f.
- **Active task**: None in code. **Phase 3c kick-off planning**
  (`ralplan`-style consensus plan anchored on ADR-0018/0019/0020) is
  the queued next step. **ADR-#2 consent decision** is the most
  blocking remaining Phase-3a item before any external demo and can
  run in parallel.

## Active worklog

`docs/worklog/2026-05-11-signing-removal.md` (closed with this
STATUS update). The prior Phase-3a decisions worklog
`docs/worklog/2026-05-11-phase-3a-decisions.md` is closed.

## Where we paused

**ADR-0021 code-removal housekeeping checkpoint, closed.** The
signing primitive is gone from the codebase: verifier module +
`trust/` registry deleted, `generate-key` + `sign-plugin` CLI
subcommands removed, four `.sig` files deleted, `keyring` + `pynacl`
deps dropped from `llm_tracker`, signing-only tests retired, and the
verifier call site in `PluginHost.load_plugins` excised. Plugin
loading now flows `entry_points → _find_manifest → disable check →
capability policy → register with EgressGuard → instantiate`, with
no cryptographic gate in between. 230 tests pass (down from 241;
the 11-diff is 11 verifier-only + 3 plugin-host signing tests,
retired without replacement — existing manifest-validation /
mode-policy / guard-wiring / introspection tests already pin the
no-signing load path end-to-end). Ruff baseline unchanged (6
pre-existing, 0 introduced). See worklog "Verification" section.

One follow-up flagged but **not** done in this commit: the server
package's `packages/llm_tracker_server/pyproject.toml` still lists
`pynacl` (planned for ADR-0007's TaskDefinition signing, which the
ADR-0017 pivot superseded). Worth a one-line cleanup once the team
confirms the server will not bring its own crypto layer. The task
spec's "Do NOT remove anything beyond this list" fence kept it out
of scope here.

### Prior workstream — Phase-3a decisions (closed 2026-05-11)

The Phase-3a decision interview (worklog
`docs/worklog/2026-05-11-phase-3a-decisions.md`) settled four of
the seven queued ADRs:

1. **ADR-0018 — Multi-tenancy: per-org + Postgres RLS only.**
   Every user-data table carries `org_id NOT NULL`; RLS policies
   are the sole enforcement; no service-role bypass; operator
   tooling runs through an `admin` role expressed inside RLS.
   Maps cleanly to enterprise self-hosted (single-org).
2. **ADR-0019 — L/A/R retired; L0–L3 kept as plugin capability.**
   The deployment-mode taxonomy disappears. The content-level
   ladder survives as a plugin-manifest `min_content_level`.
   Server-side storage is a **single uniform shape**; no per-user
   retention differentiation in the near term.
3. **ADR-0020 — Auth: per-org token (agent→server) + Anthropic
   credential pass-through (server→Anthropic).** Tokens align
   directly with ADR-0018's per-org RLS context. The server
   **never persists** the user's Anthropic API key — it forwards
   it transiently and discards it after each response stream.
   Zero KMS/Vault build-out; Anthropic-ToS posture is the safest
   available.
4. **ADR-0021 — Plugin manifest signing fully retired.** ADR-0008's
   threat model (user-side `plugin.toml` tampering) disappeared
   with the pivot to server-side plugin execution. The team
   decided not to repurpose signing as a deployment-time trust
   gate (YAGNI for a one-person contributor team). The trust root
   for plugin loading is now the deploy pipeline itself (git +
   CI + server filesystem permissions). Code-removal is a
   separate Phase-3c-prep checkpoint.

**ADRs touched in this workstream**:

- ADR-0018 (new, Accepted) — multi-tenancy boundary.
- ADR-0019 (new, Accepted) — mode-taxonomy fate.
- ADR-0020 (new, Accepted) — auth model.
- ADR-0021 (new, Accepted) — signing fate (supersedes ADR-0008).
- ADR-0008 — status changed to **Superseded by ADR-0021**.
- ADR-0006 — supersession note extended to point at ADR-0019 as
  the ADR that closes its "what survives of L/A/R" open question.

**Where my recommendation differed from the user's pick**: For
ADR-#7 I recommended Option B (repurpose signing as
deployment-time trust). The user picked Option A (full retirement)
on YAGNI grounds. Decision is final; rationale and counter-argument
preserved in `docs/worklog/2026-05-11-phase-3a-decisions.md`
§Decisions.

## Phase 3a — decision ADR queue (4 of 7 settled)

| # | Topic | Status | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fallback policy when server unreachable | **Pending** (defers Phase 3b; not on critical path under server-first reframe) | — |
| 2 | Consent + data-handling policy | **Pending** (most blocking remaining item *before any external testing*; operator-only demo not blocked) | — |
| 3 | Agent-to-server auth model | **Settled 2026-05-11** | **ADR-0020** |
| 4 | Local agent language/distribution | **Pending** (defers Phase 3b; not on critical path under server-first reframe) | — |
| 5 | Multi-tenancy boundary | **Settled 2026-05-11** | **ADR-0018** |
| 6 | What survives of ADR-0006 L/A/R modes | **Settled 2026-05-11** | **ADR-0019** |
| 7 | What survives of ADR-0008 signing | **Settled 2026-05-11** — fully retired | **ADR-0021** |

Items 1, 2, 4 do **not** block Phase 3c (server build-out): the
server can be built against ADR-0018/0019/0020 schemas and surfaces
without resolving them. #2 is required before the server is shown
to anyone outside the operator.

### Prior workstream — `supabase_sink` (closed 2026-05-08, CP9)

ADR-0007's reference Mode-R plugin is operational against the
operator's real Supabase project (7 rows in `public.exchanges` from
Path 1). All three safety paths verified against real traffic in CP9:

- **Path 1 — Happy** (`Mode R` + opted_in + correct manifest):
  7 rows landed; `request_text` / `response_text` / `usage`
  populated as expected; one row has `model_served=null` (HTTP
  error response from Anthropic — non-SSE body — by-design
  observability hole, see CP9 worklog "Observation").
- **Path 2 — Mode L safety**: `capability_denied` at proxy
  startup, plugin never loaded, 0 new rows, `claude` response
  flowed through the proxy normally. Production equivalent of
  `test_e2e_mode_l_rejects_plugin_at_load_time`.
- **Path 3 — Allowlist mismatch**: manifest's `egress_destinations`
  set to a bogus URL → plugin loaded but `EgressGuard` denied
  every fetch with `reason=destination_not_in_allowlist`; 0 new
  rows; 4 `egress_blocked` audit rows; manifest restored +
  re-signed (ed25519 deterministic → byte-identical to CP8).

> **Note (2026-05-11)**: ADR-0021 retires signing entirely. The
> manifest re-signing path used in CP9 will disappear when the
> code-removal checkpoint lands. The `supabase_sink` plugin itself
> stays valid as a server-side analytics output.

**Workstream artefacts** (per CLAUDE.md §10 public-interface
catalogue):

- ADR-0015 — `EgressClient` Protocol + `EgressResponse` +
  `EgressDenied`; `BasePlugin.egress` / `HookContext.egress`
  reference the *same* per-plugin instance bound at load time.
- ADR-0016 — `LLMTRACK_USER_OPTED_IN` env knob (interim consent
  surface; per-task UX still deferred per ADR-0006 §"Open
  questions").
- New SDK module: `llm_tracker_sdk.egress`.
- New core module: `llm_tracker.egress_guard.client` (`HostEgressClient`).
- New `PluginHost` constructor params: `http_client`,
  `user_opted_in`. New `SHUTDOWN_HOOK_TIMEOUT` = 30 s for sink
  drain.
- New plugin package: `packages/llm_tracker_plugin_supabase_sink/`
  (signed by `minseop`, 55 unit + 3 integration tests).
- Supabase: `public.exchanges` table + RLS enabled (CP4).
- Operator UX: proxy reads `.env` at lifespan; refreshed
  `.env.example` to match the current `Settings` surface.

Closed-checkpoint roll-up (cleanup pass A–G + stop gates +
side-quests):

- A (e2ee4f0): EgressGuard wired into proxy lifespan
- B (3010aae): signature verifier wired + signing CLI
- C (a2bc3d4): on_persisted ordering fix
- D (b1724fa): synthetic SSE block response
- E (2891e8f): audit_log append-only triggers
- F (6a08c9c): ADR-0008 housekeeping
- G (96305e1): session_factory property + ADR-0009
- 14 (654fbfb): ADR-0010 retroactive (Block/Abort.plugin)
- 15 (cfbbb8e): ADR-0011 Transform policy
- 16 (bbb33e7): Transform impl + 4 tests
- 17 (4606ed0): ADR-0012 hook payload routing
- 18 (75ff46a): HookContext impl + 14 tests
- pre-1c verification (2c28f68): TEST-ONLY token_counter + keyword_block
- side-quest #2 (d2e33d5, 9aa8321): `claude-manage` wrapper + async cleanup
- side-quest #3 (0a43502, 161505d): plugin disable config + `/admin/plugins`
- supabase_sink workstream (8712183, f75a841, dff7e3e, a3b5dff,
  9088825, 6ab979c, 4294d10, f420000, f2f53b7, + this CP9
  finalize commit): ADR-0015/0016 + `EgressClient` SDK +
  `LLMTRACK_USER_OPTED_IN` + Supabase schema + the plugin itself
  + `SHUTDOWN_HOOK_TIMEOUT` + signed manifest + `.env` lifespan
  loader + manual e2e

## Phase 1c prerequisites (reframed under ADR-0019)

These three items were Phase-1c carry-overs. **ADR-0019 (2026-05-11)
reframes them server-side**:

- **L2 scrubbed shape of `request_text`**. Scrubber primitives now
  run on the central server, not per user machine. Pinned by
  `test_hook_context.py::test_request_text_returns_body_at_l2_when_ceiling_allows`
  so the eventual change is test-visible. Lands in Phase 3c.
- **Manifest `min_content_level` field** (ADR-0012 §"Open
  questions"). ADR-0019 confirms this primitive survives the
  pivot. Add the schema field + validator + host enforcement
  during Phase 3c. Separate ADR if the host-side semantics surface
  anything non-obvious.
- **Response-side `ctx` accessors** (`response_text`,
  `tool_call_inputs`, etc.). ADR-0012 ships only the request-side
  accessors. Response-side data needs the Phase-2 Extractor to
  surface structured response records first; separate ADR if the
  semantics surface anything non-obvious (e.g. partial vs assembled).

## Next single step

**Phase 3c kick-off planning.** A `ralplan`-style consensus plan
(Planner + Architect + Critic) that breaks down the server
build-out into commit-sized checkpoints, anchored on the three
schema/edge ADRs:

- ADR-0018 (per-org tenancy + RLS) → server-side DB schema with
  `org_id NOT NULL` on every user-data table.
- ADR-0019 (single uniform storage shape; L0–L3 survives as
  plugin-manifest `min_content_level`) → no per-user retention
  differentiation.
- ADR-0020 (per-org token + Anthropic credential pass-through) →
  auth middleware + zero-persistence credential handling.

In parallel, the **ADR-#2 consent decision** is the most blocking
remaining Phase-3a item before any external demo. Operator-only
demo is not blocked. Legal/privacy input may take longer than
internal ADR drafting; flag to start alongside Phase 3c.

The user-deferred items #1 (fallback) and #4 (agent language) are
**not on the critical path** under the current server-first
reframe; they re-enter the queue once Phase 3b (thin agent) is
ready to start.

## Blocking / decisions needed

- **#2 consent + data-handling**: still owed before *any external
  testing* of the central server. Not blocking the operator-only
  demo path. Legal/privacy review may take longer than internal
  ADR drafting; flag to start in parallel with Phase 3c.
- **#1 fallback** and **#4 agent language**: deferred to Phase 3b
  scoping; not blocking anything Phase 3a or 3c.

## Update rules (for Claude Code)

At every checkpoint, do these three as one atomic unit (CLAUDE.md §5.3):

1. `git commit` the code change (CLAUDE.md §11).
2. Append the new commit hash to the active worklog's "What was done"
   section, and rewrite the "What's left / Handoff" section as of *now*.
3. Refresh this STATUS.md:
   - Last-updated timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Active worklog path.
   - Last 3–5 commits.
   - "Where we paused".
   - "Next single step".

If you don't bundle these three, the next session won't know where to pick
up.
