# Plugin Authoring Guide

All *features* in this framework live in plugins. This document defines the
contract a plugin author can rely on. Core design is in `design.md`; the
security policy is in ADR-0006.

## 1. What a plugin is

- A Python package, installed alongside the core.
- It registers itself via the `llm_tracker.plugins` setuptools entry point.
- It carries a `plugin.toml` manifest at the package root.
- It subclasses `BasePlugin` and overrides whichever hooks it needs.
- Outside of its declared capabilities, it cannot do anything (enforced).

## 2. `plugin.toml` schema

All fields are validated by `llm_tracker_sdk.manifest.PluginManifest` at
load time. Unknown fields are rejected.

```toml
name = "my_plugin"          # required; becomes the DB namespace
version = "0.1.0"           # required
description = "..."         # optional

# Hooks the plugin binds to (subset of the 8 hooks below)
hooks = ["before_forward", "on_persisted"]

# Capabilities required (operator must approve each one)
capabilities = ["read_request_content", "block_request"]

# Egress allowlist (exact match; no wildcards). Requires egress_http capability.
egress_destinations = []

# Deployment modes the manifest was originally written for. ADR-0019
# retired runtime mode enforcement; the field is retained for
# backward-compat with manifests written before the server pivot and
# is reported by `/admin/plugins` (ADR-0014) but no longer gates load.
allowed_modes = ["A", "R"]

# Content-level ceiling for what this plugin sees through `HookContext`
# (ADR-0019, CP10). One of "L0" / "L1" / "L2" / "L3"; default "L3"
# when the field is absent. The server-side `PluginHost` re-points
# `ctx._ceiling` per plugin before every hook dispatch, so an L1
# plugin cannot reach raw `request_text` even when a sibling L3
# plugin in the same chain can. Authors opt *down* explicitly --
# an absent field never silently restricts data.
min_content_level = "L3"

# SQLite table prefix (defaults to empty; use name if you own tables)
db_namespace = "my_plugin"
```

Use `PluginManifest.from_path(Path("plugin.toml"))` to validate programmatically.

## 3. Hook lifecycle

| Hook | When | Allowed returns |
|---|---|---|
| `on_init` | Once at proxy boot | (none) |
| `on_request_received` | Right after intake, before validation | `Pass` / `Block(reason)` |
| `before_forward` | After validation, before upstream | `Pass` / `Block(reason)` / `Transform(headers, body)` |
| `on_upstream_response_start` | Upstream response headers arrive | `Pass` / `Abort(reason)` |
| `on_response_chunk` | Each streamed chunk | `Pass` / `Abort(reason)` |
| `on_response_complete` | `message_stop` event | (observe only) |
| `on_persisted` | After local DB write (async OK) | (observe only) |
| `on_shutdown` | At process shutdown | (none) |

`Block` / `Abort` results in a synthetic response delivered to the client.

### 3.1 What `HookContext` exposes per level

Every per-exchange hook receives a `HookContext` (ADR-0012). The
context has lazy accessors for the request body that degrade against
the plugin's manifest `min_content_level` (CP10).

Under the server-side runtime (ADR-0019), the effective ceiling is the
plugin's own `min_content_level` -- not the deployment mode and not an
operator opt-in flag. The server's `PluginHost` re-points
`ctx._ceiling` per plugin before every hook dispatch, so two plugins
sharing the same exchange context see different shapes:

| Plugin's `min_content_level` | `request_text(level)` | `request_hash()` | `request_length()` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `L0`                                 | `None`             | `None`         | `None`         |
| `L1` (default for "metadata-only" sinks) | `None`         | hex SHA-256    | byte length    |
| `L2`                                 | raw decoded text\* | hex SHA-256    | byte length    |
| `L3` (default when the field is absent) | raw decoded text | hex SHA-256  | byte length    |

\* L2 returns the raw decoded text today. The "scrubbed" shape
described in design.md §7.1 still lands as a Phase 3c follow-up
alongside the server-side scrubber primitives — until then a plugin
asking for L2 receives the same bytes it would get at L3.

The legacy mode-keyed ceiling math
(`effective_ceiling(mode, user_opted_in=...)`) is preserved inside the
SDK as a fallback path so plugins written against the original
local-sidecar shape (`packages/llm_tracker/`) still run, but the
server-side path always wins when a manifest declares a level.

**Reading rules of thumb**:

- Plugins that only need fingerprints (dedup, "did this exact prompt
  repeat") call `request_hash()` / `request_length()` — these work in
  Mode L without any consent flow.
- Plugins that must read the body call `request_text(level)`. Treat
  `None` as "no signal at this ceiling, fall through" rather than
  blocking blindly — that's the policy the test-only `keyword_block`
  plugin demonstrates.
- The accessor returns `None` if the body has not been delivered to
  the context yet (e.g. a hook firing before the forwarder reads the
  body) and if the body is not valid UTF-8.

### 3.2 What the scrubber does to plugin-visible content

Both `request_text()` and `response_content_json()` pipe their return
value through `llm_tracker_sdk.scrubbers.scrub` before handing it to the
plugin (ADR-0029). Five pattern families are redacted in place:
`sk-…`, `lts_…`, `Bearer <value>` (case-insensitive — also catches the
value half of an `Authorization: Bearer …` header echoed in body text),
and email addresses. Matches become `[REDACTED:secret]` /
`[REDACTED:token]` / `[REDACTED:bearer]` / `[REDACTED:email]` so an
operator can grep historical rows for what fired.

The canonical bytes on `HookContext._raw_request_body` and the parsed
response on `HookContext._parsed_response` are left untouched **in
memory** during the request lifetime. What actually reaches disk depends
on which write path the row comes from:

- `public.exchanges` (server core) stores metadata only — there is no
  request- or response-text column, so the question of canonical vs.
  scrubbed body does not apply.
- `public.plugin_analytics` (written by the `analytics_sink` plugin)
  populates `messages_json` from `ctx.request_text()` and `response_json`
  from `ctx.response_content_json()`. Both accessors scrub before
  returning, so **the rows on this table are also scrubbed** —
  `sk-…` / `lts_…` / `Bearer …` / email matches land as `[REDACTED:…]`
  tags. A plugin author querying this table directly sees the same
  shape an in-process plugin sees through the accessor.

The retention policy in `docs/deploy.md` §"Data collection & privacy"
(6-month operator-handled deletion) bounds whatever the plugin chooses to
retain on its tables.

## 4. Capability vocabulary

Declare required capabilities in `plugin.toml`. The operator approves each
at install time; changing the manifest requires re-approval.

| Constant (`llm_tracker_sdk.capabilities.*`) | Token string | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `READ_REQUEST_METADATA` | `read_request_metadata` | Model name, token counts, scrubbed headers, timing |
| `READ_REQUEST_CONTENT` | `read_request_content` | User prompts and tool_result bodies |
| `READ_RESPONSE_METADATA` | `read_response_metadata` | Response usage, stop_reason |
| `READ_RESPONSE_CONTENT` | `read_response_content` | Response body (incl. streamed chunks) |
| `MODIFY_REQUEST` | `modify_request` | Mutate the upstream request before forward |
| `BLOCK_REQUEST` | `block_request` | Issue a synthetic block response |
| `ABORT_RESPONSE` | `abort_response` | Terminate an in-progress response stream |
| `READ_PERSISTED_DATA` | `read_persisted_data` | Read the local SQLite DB |
| `WRITE_PLUGIN_TABLES` | `write_plugin_tables` | Write to your own DB namespace |
| `EGRESS_HTTP` | `egress_http` | Outbound HTTP through EgressGuard (requires allowlist) |

## 5. Writing a plugin

### Install

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/<owner>/Userfriendly.git#subdirectory=packages/llm_tracker_sdk"
```

### Minimal plugin

```python
# src/my_plugin/__init__.py
from llm_tracker_sdk import BasePlugin, Block, Pass


class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    name = "my_plugin"

    async def before_forward(self, exchange_id: str) -> Pass | Block:
        # exchange_id identifies this request in the local DB
        return Pass()
```

Register via `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."llm_tracker.plugins"]
my_plugin = "my_plugin:MyPlugin"
```

### Overriding hooks

Override only the hooks your plugin needs. Unoverridden hooks default to
`Pass()` (or no-op for observe-only hooks). `BasePlugin` is a concrete
class — no abstract methods to satisfy.

```python
from llm_tracker_sdk import Abort, BasePlugin, Block, Pass, Transform
from llm_tracker_sdk import capabilities


class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    name = "my_plugin"

    async def on_request_received(self, exchange_id: str) -> Pass | Block:
        return Pass()

    async def before_forward(self, exchange_id: str) -> Pass | Block | Transform:
        return Transform(headers={"x-custom": "1"})

    async def on_response_chunk(self, exchange_id: str, chunk: bytes) -> Pass | Abort:
        return Pass()
```

## 6. Testing your plugin

Use `llm_tracker_sdk.testing.PluginHarness`:

```python
from llm_tracker_sdk.testing import PluginHarness
from my_plugin import MyPlugin


async def test_passes_normal_request():
    harness = PluginHarness(MyPlugin())
    await harness.init()
    result = await harness.on_request_received()
    harness.assert_pass(result)


async def test_blocks_flagged_request():
    harness = PluginHarness(MyPlugin())
    result = await harness.on_request_received("special-exchange-id")
    harness.assert_block(result, reason_contains="out of scope")
```

Assertion helpers: `assert_pass`, `assert_block(reason_contains=...)`,
`assert_transform`, `assert_abort(reason_contains=...)`.

## 7. DB tables

A plugin owns tables inside its `db_namespace`. Naming convention:
`plugin_<namespace>__<table>`. Schema migrations live in the plugin's
own Alembic version directory; the core applies them at install time.

## 8. Outbound HTTP (Phase 1b)

Direct use of `requests` / `urllib` / `httpx` from plugin code is
**forbidden** — blocked by lint rule and code review. A safe egress API
(`ctx.egress.fetch(url, ...)` routed through EgressGuard) arrives in Phase
1b. For now, plugins that need egress must wait for that phase. EgressGuard
enforces: (a) exact-match against `egress_destinations`, (b) operator
approval, (c) mode permission.

## 9. Mode-aware behavior (legacy)

The manifest's `allowed_modes` was originally used by the local
sidecar to gate plugin load against a deployment mode (L/A/R). ADR-0019
retired runtime mode enforcement when the project pivoted to a central
server. The field is still parsed and reported by `/admin/plugins` so
existing manifests load unchanged, but it no longer gates loading; what
a plugin can see is decided by its own `min_content_level` (§2, §3.1)
and what it can reach over the network is decided by `EgressGuard`
against `egress_destinations`.

## 10. Isolation and trust

Through Phase 1, plugins run in-process. A determined plugin can bypass
EgressGuard with raw sockets — policy forbids it, but strict sandboxing is
Phase 3 (subprocess). Therefore: *do not install plugins you don't trust*.
Code review and explicit capability approval are the primary defense; the
trust root for server-side plugin loading is the deploy pipeline itself
(git + CI + server filesystem permissions) per ADR-0021.

## 11. Reference plugins

| Package | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `llm-tracker-plugin-hello-world` | `packages/llm_tracker_plugin_hello_world/` | Phase 0 verification no-op |
| `llm-tracker-plugin-scope-guard` | `packages/llm_tracker_plugin_scope_guard/` | Server-side scope monitor on `on_persisted` (ADR-0030, Phase 1c). Two-stage embedding + judge pipeline; observe-only; writes `public.scope_alerts`. |
| `llm-tracker-plugin-supabase-sink` | `packages/llm_tracker_plugin_supabase_sink/` | Mode R upload sink (Phase 2) |

Install from git URL:

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/<owner>/Userfriendly.git#subdirectory=packages/llm_tracker_plugin_hello_world"
```

The `scope_guard` plugin needs a per-org scope corpus before its
`on_persisted` evaluations have anything to score against. Register
one with the bundled CLI (added in ADR-0030 CP6) — both invocations
work after `uv sync`:

```
process-scope-document <org_id> <file.md>
python -m llm_tracker_plugin_scope_guard.process_scope_document <org_id> <file.md>
```

Accepted formats: `.txt` and `.md`. The CLI is idempotent on
`(org_id, title)` (delete-then-insert per ADR-0030 §D5; `title`
defaults to the file's stem). It needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` +
`LLMTRACK_DATABASE_URL` in env — same shape as the plugin's
`on_init`.

## 12. Running locally — server-side load path

Under the server-side runtime (`packages/llm_tracker_server/`, ADR-0017),
plugins are loaded once at process startup by the `PluginHost` inside
the FastAPI `lifespan` callback. The mechanism is the same setuptools
entry-point machinery the local sidecar uses; the differences are
where the host runs and what the manifest gates.

**Entry-point group**. The server scans the `llm_tracker.plugins`
entry-point group via `importlib.metadata.entry_points`. Register your
plugin class in `pyproject.toml` exactly as you would for the
sidecar:

```toml
[project.entry-points."llm_tracker.plugins"]
my_plugin = "my_plugin:MyPlugin"
```

The host installs every plugin it finds at boot. There is no
operator-side allowlist; the trust root is the deploy pipeline (git +
CI + server filesystem permissions) per ADR-0021.

**Manifest discovery**. For each entry point the host loads the class,
then looks up `plugin.toml` next to the class's module. Manifest
validation is the same `PluginManifest.model_validate` path documented
in §2; failures land in the `audit_log` as
`kind=manifest_rejected` and the plugin is skipped, not crashed
through.

**Per-plugin ceiling clamp (CP10)**. After the manifest validates, the
host records `manifest.min_content_level` (default `L3`) and applies it
on every per-exchange hook dispatch by re-pointing `ctx._ceiling`
before the plugin's `_call` -- the same `ctx` is reused across hooks
per ADR-0012, but each plugin sees a freshly-bound view. The same
preamble sets `ctx.egress` to the plugin's own `HostEgressClient`
(ADR-0015) so attribution stays stable.

**Local dev loop**. To run the server against a disposable Postgres:

```bash
docker run -d --name llm-tracker-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=cp2 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cp2 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=llm_tracker \
  -p 55432:5432 postgres:15

export LLMTRACK_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://cp2:cp2@localhost:55432/llm_tracker
alembic -c packages/llm_tracker_server/alembic.ini upgrade head

uvicorn llm_tracker_server.app:app --reload --port 8080
```

Mint a per-org token for local development:

```bash
llm-tracker-server tokens issue --org demo
```

`GET /admin/plugins` then returns the introspection payload for every
plugin the host wired up, including each plugin's declared
`min_content_level`.
